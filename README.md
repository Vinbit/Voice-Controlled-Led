                                                                              **VOICE CONTROLLED LED**


This Project aims to control a series of led light using voice commands that are taken through a mobile app.The mobile app uses the on device text-to-speech algorithm to convert your command
to a string and pass it on to the arduino and the functions are performed according to the code.

**Requirements for the Project**

1.Arduino UNO3 Board
2.HC05 (Bluetooth ) module
3.Jumper Wires
4.Leds
5.Bread Board
6.Arduino IDE [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software]
7.IOT Remote app [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.arduino.cloudiot&hl=en&gl=US]


**Steps to create the project**

Step1:Install arduino ide on the system and create the code file and copy the code.
step2:Create the circuit and connect the components accordingly
step3: Upload the project on the arduino uno3 board 
step4: Install the app on your device and connect it to the HC05 module connected with the arduino
step5:Enjoy the results!!
